# AIM - Accelerating Interactive Moments

## Introduction

**AIM** is a next-generation **social connectivity platform** designed to revolutionize how people connect, interact, and build communities. AIM bridges the gap between physical and virtual connections, providing **seamless, secure, and versatile tools** for personal, professional, and group interactions.

AIM takes inspiration from platforms like Zenly, NFC-based systems, and advanced social networking applications, but goes a step further by introducing **Shake-to-Connect**, **NFC Tap-to-Connect**, **real-time group formation**, and **integrated payments**. It combines these features into a single, intuitive, and highly interactive application.

## Vision

The vision of AIM is to:
- **Make Connections Effortless:** Users can shake their phones or tap using NFC to instantly connect with others.
- **Foster Interactive Experiences:** Create dynamic groups, share locations, and engage with stories and feeds in real-time.
- **Enhance Privacy and Security:** Provide granular control over personal details while ensuring end-to-end encrypted interactions.
- **Unify Social and Professional Needs:** With distinct modes, AIM supports both casual social networking and professional networking.

## Technical Architecture

### **Frontend**
- **Technology:** React Native
- **Description:** A cross-platform mobile application designed for both iOS and Android.

### **Backend**
- **Technology:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Description:** Handles APIs for real-time matching, group creation, location sharing, and user interactions.

### **Database**
- **Primary:** MongoDB (for persistent storage of user and group data).
- **Temporary:** Redis (for session management during Shake-to-Connect or group creation).

### **Real-Time Communication**
- **Technology:** WebSocket or Firebase
- **Description:** Enables real-time updates for user matching, group formation, and chat interactions.

### **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Provider:** AWS
- **Services Used:** S3 (storage), EC2 (compute), Lambda (serverless functions).

### **Security**
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0, JWT
- **Encryption:** End-to-end encryption for all communications and data exchanges.

## How It Works

### **1. Shake-to-Connect**
1. User shakes their phone, activating the accelerometer.
2. Location and timestamp are sent to the backend.
3. The backend matches users within a 100m radius and returns a list of nearby individuals or groups.
4. The user selects to either:
   - Add individual friends (sorted by proximity).
   - Join a group.

### **2. NFC Tap-to-Connect**
1. Users tap their phones together.
2. NFC exchanges encrypted contact details or group joining requests.
3. Data is securely stored and updated in the backend.

### **3. Real-Time Group Formation**
1. Users shaking within proximity form a temporary group in Redis.
2. Group details (members, location) are visible to others within range.
3. Groups persist until users disband or timeout.
